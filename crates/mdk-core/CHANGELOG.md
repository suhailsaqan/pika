### Breaking changes

- **`create_key_package_for_event` Return Type Change**: The return type changed from `(String, Vec<Tag>)` to `(String, Vec<Tag>, Vec<u8>)`. The third element is the serialized hash_ref of the key package, computed atomically during creation. This enables callers to track key packages for lifecycle management (publish → consume → cleanup) without needing to re-parse the package. Callers that don't need the hash_ref can destructure with `_`. ([#178](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/178))
- **`create_key_package_for_event` Return Type Change**: The return type changed from `(String, [Tag; 7])` to `(String, Vec<Tag>)`. Most code patterns (iteration, indexing) continue to work unchanged. This change was necessary because the protected tag is now optional. ([#173](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/173), related: [#168](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/168))
- **`create_key_package_for_event` No Longer Adds Protected Tag**: The `create_key_package_for_event()` function no longer adds the NIP-70 protected tag (`["-"]`) by default. This is a behavioral change - existing code that relied on the protected tag being present will now produce key packages without it. Key packages can now be republished by third parties to any relay. This improves relay compatibility since many popular relays (Damus, Primal, nos.lol) reject protected events outright. For users who need the protected tag, use the new `create_key_package_for_event_with_options()` function with `protected: true`. ([#173](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/173), related: [#168](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/168))
- **OpenMLS 0.8.0 Upgrade**: Upgraded from a git-pinned openmls 0.7.1 to the crates.io openmls 0.8.0 release. This resolves security advisory [GHSA-8x3w-qj7j-gqhf](https://github.com/openmls/openmls/security/advisories/GHSA-8x3w-qj7j-gqhf) (improper tag validation) and moves GREASE support from a git pin to an official release. Companion crates updated: `openmls_traits` 0.5, `openmls_basic_credential` 0.5, `openmls_rust_crypto` 0.5. ([#174](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/174))

### Changed

- **Welcome processing uses builder API**: Welcome message parsing now uses `StagedWelcome::build_from_welcome` with `replace_old_group()` to handle openmls 0.8.0's `GroupId` uniqueness enforcement. ([#174](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/174))
- **Message Processing Timestamps**: Messages now record both `created_at` (from the rumor event, reflecting sender's clock) and `processed_at` (when this client processed the message). This allows clients to choose their preferred ordering strategy - by creation time or by reception time. ([#166](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/166))
- **MIP-03 Commit Race Resolution**: Commits are now resolved deterministically based on timestamp (earliest wins) and event ID (lexicographically smallest wins). ([#152](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/152))
  - When multiple valid commits are published for the same epoch, clients converge on the same "winning" commit.
  - If a "better" commit (earlier timestamp) arrives after a "worse" commit has been applied, the client automatically rolls back to the previous epoch and applies the winning commit.
  - This ensures consistent group state across all clients even with out-of-order message delivery.
- Upgraded `nostr` dependency from 0.43 to 0.44, replacing deprecated `Timestamp::as_u64()` calls with `Timestamp::as_secs()` ([#162](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/162))

### Added

- **KeyPackage deletion by hash_ref bytes**: Added `delete_key_package_from_storage_by_hash_ref()` to delete a key package using previously serialized hash_ref bytes. This enables delayed key material cleanup workflows where the hash_ref is obtained at creation time (via `create_key_package_for_event`) and used for deletion later. ([#178](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/178))
- **Custom Message Sort Order**: `get_messages()` now supports custom sort orders via the `Pagination::sort_order` field. Added `get_last_message(group_id, sort_order)` method to retrieve the most recent message under a given sort order, enabling clients using `ProcessedAtFirst` ordering to get a consistent "last message" value. ([#171](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/171))
- **`create_key_package_for_event_with_options`**: New function that allows specifying whether to include the NIP-70 protected tag. Use this if you need to publish to relays that accept protected events. ([#173](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/173), related: [#168](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/168))
- **MIP-04 Epoch Fallback for Media Decryption**: `decrypt_from_download` now resolves the correct decryption key via an O(1) epoch hint lookup instead of only using the current epoch's exporter secret. Added `NoExporterSecretForEpoch` variant to `EncryptedMediaError` for programmatic error matching. ([#167](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/167))
- **`PreviouslyFailed` Result Variant**: Added `MessageProcessingResult::PreviouslyFailed` variant to handle cases where a previously failed message arrives again but the MLS group ID cannot be extracted. This prevents crashes in client applications by returning a result instead of throwing an error. ([#165](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/165), fixes [#154](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/154), [#159](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/159))
- **Message Retry Support**: Implemented better handling for retryable message states. When a message fails processing, it now preserves the `message_event_id` and other context. Added logic to allow reprocessing of messages marked as `Retryable`, with automatic state recovery to `Processed` upon success. ([#161](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/161))
- Configurable `out_of_order_tolerance` and `maximum_forward_distance` in `MdkConfig` for MLS sender ratchet settings. Default `out_of_order_tolerance` increased from 5 to 100 for better handling of out-of-order message delivery on Nostr relays. ([`#155`](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/155))
- **Epoch Snapshots & Rollback**: Added `EpochSnapshotManager` to maintain historical epoch states for rollback. ([#152](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/152))
- **Configuration**: Added `epoch_snapshot_retention` to `MdkConfig` (default: 5) to control how many past epochs are retained for rollback support. ([#152](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/152))
- **Rollback Callback**: Added `MdkCallback` trait and `MdkBuilder::with_callback()` to allow applications to react to rollback events (e.g., to refresh UI). ([#152](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/152))

### Fixed

- **Security dependency updates**: Updated `time` (0.3.44 → 0.3.47), `bytes` (1.11.0 → 1.11.1), and `lru` (0.16.2 → 0.16.3) to resolve Dependabot security advisories. ([#174](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/174))
- **Message Ordering Consistency**: Fixed inconsistency where `group.last_message_id` might not match `get_messages()[0].id` due to different sorting logic. The `last_message_id` update logic now uses `created_at DESC, processed_at DESC, id DESC` ordering to match the `messages()` query, ensuring the first message returned is always the same as `last_message_id`. Added `last_message_processed_at` field to `Group` to track this secondary sort key. ([#166](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/166))
- **Security**: Prevent `GroupId` leakage in `test_commit_race_simple_better_commit_wins` assertion failure messages to avoid exposing sensitive identifiers in logs. ([#152](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/152))

### Removed

- **`compute_key_package_hash_ref` removed**: This method is no longer needed now that `create_key_package_for_event` returns the hash_ref directly as its third tuple element. Callers should use the hash_ref from `create_key_package_for_event` instead. ([#178](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/178))

### Deprecated

- **Unified Storage Architecture**: `MdkProvider` now uses the storage provider directly as the OpenMLS `StorageProvider`, instead of accessing it via `openmls_storage()`. This enables atomic transactions across MLS and MDK state for proper commit race resolution per MIP-03. Storage implementations must now directly implement `StorageProvider<1>`. ([#148](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/148))
- **OpenMLS Dependency**: Updated to OpenMLS git main branch (commit b90ca23b) for GREASE support. This may introduce minor API changes from upstream. The dependency will be reverted to crates.io versions once OpenMLS releases a version with GREASE support. ([#142](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/142))
- **Legacy Format Removal**: Removed support for legacy key package tag formats and extension formats that were deprecated after EOY 2025 migration period ([#146](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/146))
  - Key package validation now only accepts MIP-00 compliant formats:
    - `mls_ciphersuite` tag must use hex format (e.g., `0x0001`), numeric (`1`) and string (`MLS_128_DHKEMX25519_AES128GCM_SHA256_Ed25519`) formats are no longer accepted
    - `mls_extensions` tag must use hex format (e.g., `0x000a`, `0xf2ee`), legacy string names (`RequiredCapabilities`, `LastResort`, etc.) and comma-separated strings are no longer accepted
    - Tag names must use `mls_ciphersuite` and `mls_extensions` prefixes; legacy `ciphersuite` and `extensions` tag names are no longer accepted
  - Removed `LegacyTlsNostrGroupDataExtension` struct and related migration code for pre-version extension format
  - Groups created before the version field was added to extensions are no longer supported
- **Security (Audit Issue M)**: Changed `get_message()` to require both `mls_group_id` and `event_id` parameters. This prevents messages from different groups from overwriting each other by scoping lookups to a specific group. ([#124](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/124))
- **Credential Identity Encoding**: Removed support for legacy 64-byte UTF-8 hex-encoded credential identities ([#15](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/15))
  - Credential identities must now be exactly 32 bytes (raw public key) per MIP-00
  - Key packages with 64-byte hex-encoded identities are no longer accepted
  - This completes the migration period that began in November 2024
- **Encrypted Media (MIP-04)**: The `derive_encryption_nonce()` function has been removed. All encrypted media must now include a random nonce in the IMETA tag (`n` field). Legacy media encrypted with deterministic nonces can no longer be decrypted. This is a breaking change to fix the security issue (Audit Issue U) where deterministic nonce derivation caused nonce reuse. ([#114](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/114))
- **BREAKING**: Changed `get_messages()` signature to accept `Option<Pagination>` parameter. Callers must now pass `None` for default pagination or `Some(Pagination::new(...))` for custom pagination ([#111](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/111))
- **BREAKING**: Changed `get_pending_welcomes()` to accept `Option<Pagination>` parameter for pagination support. Existing calls should pass `None` for default pagination. ([#110](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- Replaced `Error::MissingWelcomeForProcessedWelcome` with `Error::WelcomePreviouslyFailed(String)`. When retrying a welcome that previously failed, the new error includes the original failure reason instead of a generic message. ([#136](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/136))
- **Content Encoding**: Removed support for hex encoding in key package and welcome event content ([#98](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/98))
  - Key packages and welcome events now require explicit `["encoding", "base64"]` tag
  - Events without encoding tags or with hex encoding are rejected
  - This change addresses security concerns about encoding ambiguity and downgrade attacks
  - Older key packages published without encoding tags are no longer supported
  - Clients should republish key packages with proper encoding tags when upgrading
- **MIP-02 Welcome Event Validation**: Encoding tag is now required for all welcome events ([#96](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/96))
  - Welcome events must now include exactly 4 tags: `relays`, `e`, `client`, and `encoding`
  - The `encoding` tag must have a value of either "hex" or "base64"
  - Relay URLs are now validated to ensure they start with `wss://` or `ws://`
  - Events missing the encoding tag or with invalid relay URLs will be rejected

### Changed

- `create_group()` now supports creating single-member groups (groups with only the creator). This enables "message to self" functionality, setting up groups before inviting members, and multi-device scenarios. When no members are provided, the method returns an empty `welcome_rumors` vec. ([#138](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/138))

### Added

- **GREASE Support (RFC 9420 Section 13.5)**: KeyPackage capabilities now automatically include random GREASE values for extensibility testing. GREASE ensures implementations correctly handle unknown values and maintains protocol forward compatibility. Values are injected into ciphersuites, extensions, proposals, and credentials capabilities. ([#142](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/142))
- New `MessageProcessingResult::PendingProposal` variant returned when a non-admin member receives a proposal. The proposal is stored as pending and awaits commitment by an admin. ([#122](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/122))
- New error variant `IdentityChangeNotAllowed` for rejecting proposals and commits that attempt to change member identity ([#126](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/126))
- Added `nostr_group_id` field to `NostrGroupDataUpdate` struct, enabling rotation of the Nostr group ID used for message routing per MIP-01 ([#127](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/127))
- New error variant `AuthorMismatch` for message author verification failures ([#40](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/40))
- New error variant `KeyPackageIdentityMismatch` for KeyPackage credential identity validation failures ([#41](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/41))
- New error variant `MissingRumorEventId` for when a rumor event is missing its ID ([#107](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/107))
- New error variants for Nostr event validation: `InvalidTimestamp`, `MissingGroupIdTag`, `InvalidGroupIdFormat`, `MultipleGroupIdTags` ([#128](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/128))
- Added `max_event_age_secs` and `max_future_skew_secs` fields to `MdkConfig` for configurable message timestamp validation. Default values are 45 days and 5 minutes respectively. ([#128](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/128))
- Added pagination support to `get_messages()` public API - accepts `Option<Pagination>` to control limit and offset for message retrieval ([#111](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/111))
- Exposed `Pagination` struct (from `mdk_storage_traits::groups`) in public API for paginated message queries ([#111](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/111))
- Added pagination support to `get_pending_welcomes()` public API - accepts `Option<Pagination>` to control limit and offset for welcome retrieval ([#110](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- Exposed `Pagination` struct (from `mdk_storage_traits::welcomes`) in public API for paginated welcome queries ([#110](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- **MIP-02 Welcome Event Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for welcome events ([#96](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/96))
  - Validates event kind is 444 (MlsWelcome)
  - Validates presence of all required tags (order-independent for interoperability)
  - Validates relay URL format using `RelayUrl::parse()` for thorough validation
  - Validates non-empty content for `e` and `client` tags
  - Validates encoding tag value is either "hex" or "base64"

### Fixed

- **Security (Audit Suggestion 5)**: Prevent panic in `process_welcome` when rumor event ID is missing. A malformed or non-NIP-59-compliant rumor now returns a `MissingRumorEventId` error instead of panicking. ([#107](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/107))
- **Security (Audit Issue A)**: Added admin authorization check for MLS commit messages. Previously, commits were merged without verifying the sender against `admin_pubkeys`, allowing non-admin members to modify group state. Now, `process_commit_message_for_group` validates that the commit sender is an admin before merging. ([#130](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/130))
- **Security (Audit Issue B)**: Added author verification to message processing to prevent impersonation attacks. The rumor pubkey is now validated against the MLS sender's credential before processing application messages. ([#40](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/40))
- **Security (Audit Issue C)**: Added validation for admin updates to prevent invalid configurations. Admin updates now reject empty admin sets and non-member public keys. ([#42](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/42))
- **Security (Audit Issue D)**: Added identity binding verification for KeyPackage events. The credential identity is now validated against the event signer to prevent impersonation attacks. ([#41](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/41))
- **Security (Audit Issue G)**: Fixed admin authorization to read from current MLS group state instead of potentially stale stored metadata. The `is_leaf_node_admin` and `is_member_admin` functions now derive admin status from the `NostrGroupDataExtension` in the MLS group context, preventing a race window where a recently demoted admin could still perform privileged operations. ([#108](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/108))
- **Security (Audit Issue H)**: Added MIP-02 validation to prevent malformed welcome events from causing storage pollution and resource exhaustion ([#96](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/96))
- **Security (Audit Issue I)**: Fixed proposals being incorrectly restricted to admins. Per the Marmot protocol specification, any member can create proposals (only admins can commit). Non-admin members can now submit legitimate proposals such as self key updates or leave proposals. When an admin receives a proposal, it is auto-committed; when a non-admin receives one, it is stored as pending. Added new `MessageProcessingResult::PendingProposal` variant to indicate proposals stored but not committed. ([#122](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/122))
- **Security (Audit Issue L)**: Added identity validation in proposal and commit processing. Proposals and commits that attempt to modify MLS credential identity fields are now rejected, as required by MIP-00. This prevents attackers from changing the binding between a member and their Nostr public key identity. ([#126](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/126))
- **Security (Audit Issue M)**: Fixed messages being overwritten across groups due to non-scoped primary key. Updated `get_message()` to require `mls_group_id` parameter and updated internal storage lookups to be group-scoped. This prevents an attacker or faulty relay from causing message loss and misattribution across groups by reusing deterministic rumor IDs. ([#124](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/124))
- **Security (Audit Issue N)**: Fixed `self_update` to not require a cached exporter secret. Previously, the function would abort with `GroupExporterSecretNotFound` when the current epoch's exporter secret was missing from storage, even though the secret was only used for debug logging. This blocked key rotation for new members or after cache loss, degrading post-compromise security. ([#121](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/121))
- **Security (Audit Issue O)**: Missing Hash Verification in decrypt_group_image Allows Storage-Level Blob Substitution ([#97](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/97))
- **Security (Audit Issue Q)**: Fixed `remove_members` to use actual leaf indices from the ratchet tree instead of enumeration indices. Previously, using `enumerate()` to derive `LeafNodeIndex` caused removal of incorrect members when the tree had holes from prior removals. Now uses `member.index` directly. ([#120](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/120))
- **Security (Audit Issue R)**: Refactor encoding handling to enforce base64 usage for key packages and welcome ([#98](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/98))
- **Security (Audit Issue S)**: Added validation for mandatory `relays` tag in MLS KeyPackage events. The `validate_key_package_tags` function now requires a `relays` tag with at least one valid relay URL, preventing acceptance of unroutable key packages that could cause delivery failures or enable denial-of-service attacks. ([#118](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/118))
- **Security (Audit Issue T)**: Fixed incomplete MIME type canonicalization in `validate_mime_type` ([#95](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- **Security (Audit Issue U)**: Fixed deterministic nonce derivation that caused nonce reuse and message linkability. Encryption now uses random nonces per encryption operation, stored in the IMETA tag. The nonce field (`n`) is now required in IMETA tags. ([#114](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/114))
- **Security (Audit Issue V)**: Replaced hard-coded MIP-04 version check with dynamic validation. Previously, the media manager explicitly checked for 'mip04-v2', which would require code changes to support future versions. Now, it validates against the supported versions defined in the crypto module, allowing for smoother protocol upgrades while still rejecting insecure legacy versions (v1). ([#145](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/145))
- **Security (Audit Issue W)**: Added MIME type validation and allowlist enforcement ([#95](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- **Security (Audit Issue Y)**: Encrypted media keys and nonces now use `Secret<T>` wrapper for automatic memory zeroization, preventing sensitive cryptographic material from persisting in memory ([#109](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/109))
- **Security (Audit Issue Z)**: Added pagination to prevent memory exhaustion from unbounded loading of group messages ([#111](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/111))
- **Security (Audit Issue AA)**: Added pagination to prevent memory exhaustion from unbounded loading of pending welcomes ([#110](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/110))
- **Security (Audit Issue AE)**: Added comprehensive Nostr-based validations when processing messages per MIP-03 requirements. The `validate_event_and_extract_group_id` function now validates timestamp bounds using `MdkConfig` settings (rejects events >5 minutes in future or >45 days old by default), and enforces exactly one `h` tag requirement with proper format validation. Note: MDK-core delegates Nostr signature verification to nostr-sdk's relay pool layer; it does not perform signature verification itself. This prevents misrouting messages via manipulated tags and degrading availability through abnormal timestamps. ([#128](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/128))
- **Security (Audit Issue AK)**: Fixed removed member commit processing to handle eviction gracefully. When a member is removed from a group and processes their removal commit, the group state is now set to `Inactive` instead of failing with a `UseAfterEviction` error. (Fixes [#80](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/80)) ([#137](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/137))
- **Security (Audit Issue AP)**: Early validation and decryption failures now persist failed processing state to prevent DoS via repeated expensive reprocessing of invalid events. Added deduplication check to reject previously failed messages immediately. Failure reasons are sanitized to prevent information leakage. ([#116](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/116))
- Fixed crash when processing messages that previously failed. Now returns `MessageProcessingResult::Unprocessable` instead of throwing an error, consistent with other unprocessable message handling. This prevents application crashes when duplicate failed messages arrive from relays. (Fixes [#154](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/issues/154)) ([#156](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/mdk/pull/156))
